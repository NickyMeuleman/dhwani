# Dhwani🎵
## An Open Source CLI tool for whole bunch of stuff..
Dhwani is light weight **NodeJs** based CLI tool🚀 with minimum dependencies, ease of use and lot more...

### Hey, why would I need it?
Well on serious note we don't know. But we created on purpose to offering following features🤗
1. Converstion from Video format to Audio Format.
1. Converstion from Audio format to Text Format.
1. Extraction of keywords from Text.

### Ok, what I need to use it?
So, we didn't build it from scratch.😐 You need to have *NodeJS* to run this library😅
Along with it, you also need [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) installed on you machine. We use it for video to audio conversion.
Also, for other features we use *IBM Watson API.* You need to have your own api key, to use these features.

### Alright I get that, but how do I install it?
Now, you have got [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Let's go towards installation of **Dhwani**.
You will be needed to follow below mentioned steps
* Clone or Download the Repository to you local machine.
* Head inside the folder using you commant line.
* Hit `npm install` to install all Node based dependencies. Check *package.json* for more info.
* Now use `npm link` to make **Dhwani** avaliable globally on your machine.

#### Congratulations 👏 You can now use it!
